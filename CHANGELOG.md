# Changelog

All notable changes to SuperSurf are documented in this file.

Format: `feat` = new capability, `fix` = bug fix, `security` = hardening, `chore` = maintenance.

## Unreleased

- **feat: `profiles.chrome_path` in `~/.supersurf/config.json`** — set an absolute Chrome/Chromium binary for managed-profile spawns (skips PATH auto-detect). `null`/omit keeps auto-detect. Also probes macOS `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/...` and Chromium.app. Requires daemon restart.
- **fix(page_diffing): `capturePageState` now injects into the MAIN world — the shadow-piercing capture below was inert without it.** `extension/src/experimental/index.ts` called `chrome.scripting.executeScript({ target, func, args })` with no `world`, so the capture walk ran in the default **isolated** world, where it returned zero open shadow roots. Net effect: every shadow-DOM mutation — adds, removes, text edits, attribute edits, visibility toggles, even a 50-node bulk append — diffed as `No visible changes detected.` at **100% confidence**. A silent false negative, not an error: an agent reading the diff would conclude its click did nothing. Measured against a ground-truth harness (10 known mutations, one per click): **2/10 before, 10/10 after**; the only remaining miss is a closed shadow root, which is unreachable from script by design. The extension's two other `executeScript` sites (`background.ts`, `handlers/console.ts`) already passed `world: 'MAIN'`; capture was the outlier.
- **fix(page_diffing): capture now pierces open shadow roots instead of only counting shadow hosts.** `capturePageState` previously incremented `shadowRootCount` on every `el.shadowRoot` hit but never descended into it, so shadow-heavy pages (measured ~34% of elements captured on reddit.com) were silently undercounted. It now walks breadth-first through open shadow roots (light DOM first), applying the same visibility/text/form-value extraction inside each — closed shadow roots (`el.shadowRoot === null`) still degrade silently, no throw. `page-diffing.ts`'s `(partial — shadow DOM present)` label and the confidence penalty for `shadowRootCount` are removed accordingly (closed roots remain undetectable from script, so no penalty/label can honestly target them); the iframe partial-capture reason is untouched.
- **fix: selector-based tools (`browser_interact`, `browser_fill_form`, `getElementCenter`) now pierce open shadow roots.** `getSelectorExpression` previously built a plain `document.querySelector(...)` string, blind to anything nested inside a shadow root. It now wraps the query in a light-DOM-first, shadow-descending walker (`queryDeep`/`queryAllDeep`, `shared/dom/shadow-walker.ts`) — an existing selector still resolves to the same light-DOM element (shadow roots are only walked on a miss), but a selector previously invisible inside a shadow root now resolves.
- fix(fingerprinting): resolve telemetry no longer hardcodes `hadRecord: false` on the happy path — a hoisted (not duplicated) `getRecord` lookup now reports truthfully whether a fingerprint already existed for the selector, and every `fingerprint` event adds a `discovery: 'new' | 'known'` field derived from it, unblinding cold-start-vs-known-element analysis in `/usage-data-audit`.
- **Named capture (playbooks write-side):** `browser_interact` actions now accept `name` (snake_case handle identity) and `purpose` (intent) fields. When the `fingerprinting` experiment is on, these bind to the element's fingerprint record on every element-targeting `browser_interact` action (click/hover/type/clear/select_option/select_custom/file_upload) via a centralized capture path shared by the coordinate and context resolvers — first-seen name is canonical, differing labels are harvested as frequency-counted aliases (never overwritten). Emits `handle.capture` / `handle.alias_added` events to the usage-metrics trail. Gated behind `fingerprinting`; no-op when off. Never rejects a missing/malformed name (normalized server-side).
- **`supersurf export` command** — bundles usage-metrics logs (`metrics-*.ndjson` + legacy `audit-*.ndjson`) from `~/.supersurf/logs/sessions/` into a timestamped `.zip` in the current directory. Shells out to the OS `zip` CLI; no redaction (logs ship as-stored, already redacted by the usage-metrics logger).
- **fix: `browser_verify_element_visible` and `browser_extract_content` (selector mode) now pierce open shadow roots too.** Both hand-rolled their own `document.querySelector(...)` instead of routing through `getSelectorExpression`, so they were still blind to shadow-nested elements after the shadow-piercing walker landed for `browser_interact`/`browser_fill_form`/`getElementCenter`. Same non-breaking guarantee: an existing selector still resolves to the same light-DOM element.

## 3.2.0 — 2026-07-03

- **fix: the `daemon` control CLI was completely dead — `supersurf daemon status|stop|restart|observe` crashed with `Cannot find module '../daemon/main'`.** The bin dispatcher (`server/src/bin/dispatcher.ts`) imported `../daemon/main`, which resolves to `server/dist/daemon/main` — a bundle-copy target (`scripts/daemon.bundle.ts`) that was **never wired into any build script**, so the file never existed. Net effect: there was no working way to stop/restart a wedged daemon via CLI; the only recovery was manually killing the PID on port 5555. The dispatcher now resolves the daemon the same way `daemon-spawn.ts` already does — through the `supersurf-daemon` package (`resolveDaemonEntry()`), which works in both local dev (workspace symlink) and a published install. Regression-locked: a test asserts the resolved daemon entry exists on disk. The dead path was invisible to CI because `bin-dispatcher.test.ts` only exercised `pickTarget`/`HELP_TEXT`, never `dispatch()`.
- **fix: a wedged daemon holding port 5555 now fails fast with the real reason instead of a blind 10s timeout, and `status` surfaces it.** Previously the daemon was spawned `stdio: 'ignore'`, so when it hit `EADDRINUSE` binding 5555 (e.g. a stale daemon already on the port) it `console.error`'d into the void and `exit(1)`'d, while `ensureDaemon` polled only for the socket file — burning the full 10s before throwing a generic "Daemon failed to start within 10 seconds." Now `ensureDaemon` captures the daemon's stderr to `~/.supersurf/daemon.startup.log`, watches the child for an early exit, and the instant it dies throws an actionable message (`port 5555 is already in use (EADDRINUSE) — … stop it with npx supersurf-daemon@latest stop …`) via the new exported `explainStartupFailure()`. The failure reason is stored on the connection manager (`lastConnectError`) and rendered in the passive `status` header (`⚠️ Last connect failed: …`), so `status` reports the port conflict instead of a bare cached "Disabled". Transparent-core: it **reports** the wedged port and lets the operator/agent act — it does **not** auto kill+rebind (that opinionated self-heal stays deferred to opt-in smart mode).
- **feat: `browser_interact` `click` now reports whether the click actually *did* anything, instead of always claiming success.** Previously a click that dispatched returned `Clicked <target>` unconditionally — even when an overlay swallowed it or the handler never fired, the agent was told it worked. The click now arms a page-context probe before dispatching (a one-shot capture listener on the resolved target + a subtree `MutationObserver` + a focus/URL/aria snapshot) and reads it back after the event settles, walking a confidence ladder: **dispatched → reached-target → produced-side-effect**. Outcomes: an observable change (DOM mutation, focus move, URL change, aria change, or a spawned tab) → `✓ Clicked`; the event reached the element but nothing changed → `⚠ … the event reached the element but nothing observable changed`; the event never reached the element → `⚠ … the synthetic click did not reach the element (overlay/stale coords)`. The capture listener only proves *delivery* to the element, **not** that React's root-delegated `onClick` ran — which is exactly why the `MutationObserver`/focus/aria window is the real side-effect signal, not the listener alone. Transparent-core: it **reports** the miss and lets the agent decide; it does **not** auto-retry or escalate the input method (that opinionated behavior is deferred to opt-in smart mode — see `smart-mode-roadmap-2026-06` B7). Probe is best-effort and never throws into the click path; on a child-frame edge, eval error, or no element under the cursor it stays silent rather than emit a false warning. Adds no new sleep (reuses the existing `detectSpawnedTabs` ~300ms settle).

- **fix: `browser_navigate` `back`/`forward` no longer hang on SPA renderer-pegging pages (e.g. X/Twitter `/compose/post`).** The post-navigation URL read was an *in-page* `eval('window.location.href')`, which runs on the renderer main thread. SPA routes like X's compose modal tear down a heavy React subtree synchronously in their `popstate` handler, pegging that thread for tens of seconds — so the in-page read queued behind the teardown and blocked until the ~50s eval timeout (a ~17s real-world hang was reproduced; the synthetic repro hit ~61s). The URL is now read from the **browser process** via `getTabs` (`chrome.tabs.query` + cached metadata — never touches the renderer), so `back`/`forward` return the post-nav URL instantly even while page JS is frozen. Proven with a CDP spike: browser-process read 0ms vs in-page read 7.8s under an 8s peg. Surgical — only the back/forward URL reads changed; `url`/`reload` are untouched. (Note: `smart_waiting`'s `waitForReady` already bounds its own wait at 10s, so the residual worst case is ≤10s, not the eliminated ~50s.)
- fix(fingerprinting): captures now land under the correct domain instead of silently mis-filing into `unknown.json`. **Root cause:** after a mid-session extension reconnect the server nulled `attachedTab` and never restored its URL — `onTabInfoUpdate` ignored updates while the tab was null, and `onReconnect` only cleared state — so every subsequent capture read an empty URL and keyed to `domain: "unknown"`. Now `onReconnect` re-queries `getTabs` to rehydrate the attached tab (URL included), and `onTabInfoUpdate` rebuilds the snapshot even from a null state (`backend/handlers.ts`, extracted as testable `rehydrateAttachedTab` / `applyTabInfoUpdate`).
- fix(fingerprinting): `file://` pages now key to a dedicated `file` bucket with the path as route (was collapsing into `unknown`), and `captureOnResolve` hard-drops any capture that still resolves to `domain: "unknown"` — the `unknown.json` bucket is unhealable (heal keys off the live domain) so writing to it is pure noise. Garbage/`about:blank`-style URLs go to the void instead of polluting the dataset.
- **Native dialogs are now held, not auto-answered.** `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt`/`beforeunload` are caught via CDP `Page.javascriptDialogOpening` and held open (the renderer stays blocked until resolved); the triggering tool's own result surfaces the dialog in the `_dialogs` envelope (`⚠ A native <type> dialog is OPEN and blocking the page…`), and the agent resolves it with `browser_handle_dialog {action: "view" | "accept" | "dismiss"}` (legacy `accept: boolean` still maps: true→accept, false→dismiss). This **supersedes** the 3.0.1 approach (MAIN-world `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` stub injection + auto-dismiss-`confirm` default + the `⚠ dialog fired → <response>` notice): there are no MAIN-world stubs and nothing is auto-answered. Fixes the `beforeunload` renderer-freeze — `beforeunload` has no `window.*` method to stub, so under the old model it reached the native CDP path with nothing listening and froze the renderer indefinitely; an in-flight command that triggers a dialog now returns immediately (the CDP event fires on the service-worker thread and resolves a race) instead of hanging to timeout, and subsequent page-touching commands short-circuit with a clear "resolve the dialog first" error while one is held. Auto-answering is removed from the transparent core and deferred to a future opt-in **smart mode** (see `smart-mode-roadmap-2026-06`).
- fix: **parallel-agent tab collision (Tier 1).** Concurrent subagents share one MCP session, so every tab-scoped tool resolved against the extension's single shared `attachedTabId` global — a sibling agent switching tabs would silently redirect another's in-flight call (a TOCTOU race). Tab-scoped tools now accept an explicit `tabId` param (pin it from `browser_tabs` so a sibling can't steer your call; omit to use the session's attached tab). Threaded end-to-end with **no per-handler duplication**: server side, `tabId` rides `ToolContext` (`args.tabId` → `buildContext(tabId)` → baked into `ctx.cdp`/`ctx.eval`) so the universal `cdp()` chokepoint in `tools/lib/cdp.ts` forwards it for the entire selector/eval/CDP surface; the few direct-`sendCmd` tools (snapshot/screenshot/window/dialog/perf/secure_fill/navigate) forward `ctx.tabId` explicitly. The `tabId` schema property is injected programmatically over a `TAB_SCOPED` set (one definition, not ~16 copies). Extension side, the single `ensureAttachedTab(explicitTabId?)` resolver honors an override **without mutating the shared global** (the correctness crux — a pin must not flip a sibling's view) and throws a clear error if the pinned tab is gone. Tier 2 (per-tab keying for the global console/network/dialog/spawned-tab buffers) is deferred to a separate change.

## 3.1.0 — 2026-06-14

- chore: closed the `supersurf` npm name-squat dispute as **abandoned**. npm Trust & Safety refused to review the squatting claim (2026-06-09, quoting policy: "we will not review squatting claims... trademark is the only path we act on"); registering a USPTO mark to force the issue isn't worth it for a FOSS name. The single-`supersurf` merge is **cancelled** (was "deferred" in 3.0.1) — SuperSurf ships permanently as `supersurf-mcp` + `supersurf-daemon`. CLAUDE.md callout updated; the `supersurf-npm-namesquat-dispute-2026-06-07` stickynote is closed/historical
- Added `fingerprinting` experiment (default off): captures a multi-signal fingerprint of resolved elements to `~/.supersurf/fingerprints/{domain}.json` and heals `browser_interact` selector misses by re-finding the element by meaning. Gated via `experiments.fingerprinting` / `SUPERSURF_EXPERIMENTS=fingerprinting`. Heals only on score ≥ 0.6 AND margin ≥ 0.10 (fail-safe → escalate otherwise). Scope: `getElementCenter` path (click/hover/drag), top frame **and** iframes (capture + heal); fill-form not covered. Capture resolves selectors via `getSelectorExpression` so `:has-text(...)` and digit-leading-id selectors fingerprint correctly. Emits per-resolve telemetry to the usage-metrics trail (`tool: "fingerprint"`, `outcome: resolved|healed|escalated`, with selector/domain/route/score/margin/hadRecord) for `/usage-data-audit`.
- **Unified action recorder (core, gated by `logging.usage_metrics`).** A recorder wraps the single `executeAction` chokepoint and logs, per `browser_interact` action, what was targeted (selector and/or x,y) and what happened (ok/error + message + duration) to the usage-metrics trail under `tool: "action"`. Gated solely by the existing `logging.usage_metrics` leaf — no separate `logging.action_recording` leaf (removed). Adds per-action granularity beyond tool-level `usage_metrics`. Records only — it does not fingerprint or resolve elements; fingerprinting/self-healing are future consumers of this chokepoint. See stickynote `self-healing-coordinate-capture-roadmap-2026-06`.
- fix(fingerprinting): `accName` now lifts the `value` attribute into the captured element name for `radio`/`checkbox`/`submit`/`button` inputs, where `value` is the human-meaningful static label. Previously these captured an empty `name` (the meaningful text — e.g. "Choose not to disclose", "No, I am a US Citizen" — sat only inside the disposable selector), starving the matcher's stable-identity field exactly where unlabeled radio groups are hardest to disambiguate. Text/password/email inputs are deliberately excluded — their `value` is transient typed content, not a label.
- fix(fingerprinting): capture now fires for **iframe-nested elements**. The frame-walk fallback in `getCenterInFrame` resolved iframe elements but never fingerprinted them — the top-frame capture wrapper (`getElementCenter` → `resolveWithHealing`) evals against the top frame, so child-frame elements were invisible to the dataset. Added a thin `ctx.captureFingerprintInContext(contextId, selector)` hook (called from `frames.ts`, wired in `tools.ts`, delegating to the gated `captureInContext` helper in the experiment module) that captures bound to the child frame's execution context.
- feat(fingerprinting): **iframe self-healing**. When a selector misses in the top frame *and* the iframe selector walk also misses, `getCenterInFrame` now scores the stored fingerprint against each child frame's DOM (`getChildFrameContexts` enumerates isolated worlds; the gated `ctx.healFingerprintInContext` hook → `healInContext` scores + gates per frame), picks the highest-scoring gate-passing hit, and translates its iframe-local center to top-frame coordinates via the shared `accumulateFrameOffset` walk. Same 0.6/0.10 gate as the top-frame path; falls through to the original "Element not found" error when no frame clears the gate. Telemetry note: an iframe heal is preceded by a top-frame `escalated` event (the top-frame `resolveWithHealing` escalates before the iframe walk runs), so `outcome: "healed"` from an iframe supersedes the immediately-preceding `escalated` for the same selector — net them when computing heal rate.
- **CLI: `supersurf profiles ls|open <name>`** — human-facing profile management. `ls` lists profiles with running/connected state; `open` launches a profile's Chromium as **user-owned**: it survives agent session teardown, daemon shutdown/idle-timeout, and the startup orphan sweep (close the window to end it). New daemon IPC method `profiles.launch`.
- **Daemon: idle timeout suppressed while a user-owned browser is running** — prevents the daemon from idling out underneath a human-opened profile browser; timer re-arms when the browser closes.
- **Fix: `profiles.connect` is now pool-aware** — an agent attaching to a profile whose browser is already connected (e.g. CLI-launched) no longer double-spawns Chromium onto the same user-data-dir.
- **Fix: dispatcher help text no longer suggests `npx supersurf@latest`** (a squatted npm name that isn't us) — corrected to `npx supersurf-mcp@latest`.

## 3.0.2 — 2026-06-07

- chore: delisted the `supersurf creds` subcommand (keychain storage + CLI remain in the tree but unrouted) until the keychain is wired into `secure_fill`; `secure_fill` now carries a soft pre-deprecation notice and stays fully functional
- docs: swept stale claims out of `README.md`, `server/README.md`, `daemon/README.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` after a cross-file audit. Removed the retired `experimental_features` tool and the nonexistent `browser_reload_extensions` tool from the tool tables; moved `secure_eval` (graduated v1.11.0) and `profiles` (graduated v2.1.0) out of the "experimental" sections and documented `secure_eval` as default-on with the `--disable-secure-eval` opt-out; pointed the npm badge at `supersurf-mcp` instead of the squatted `supersurf`; corrected the daemon README's `session_ack` payload (no `capabilities.profiles` field) and auto-spawn description (bundled local resolution, not `npx @latest`); fixed `tools/frames.ts` → `tools/lib/frames.ts` and the membrane test path in CLAUDE.md, added the `shared/config` + `shared/keychain` submodules and six unlisted server test files, and added a prominent npm-name-squat callout pointing to the `supersurf-npm-namesquat-dispute-2026-06-07` tracker

## 3.0.1 — 2026-06-06

- **BREAKING: feat**: v3 repackaging — `supersurf-mcp` (server) and `supersurf-daemon` (daemon) ship the new bin dispatcher (`supersurf mcp` / `supersurf daemon` / `supersurf creds` subcommands), the version-mismatch guard, and explicit-`mcp` behavior: a bare `supersurf` (or `--help`/`-h`) prints usage to stdout and exits 0 instead of silently starting the stdio server, and an unrecognized command prints usage to stderr and exits 1. The old bin aliases (`supersurf-mcp`, `supersurf-daemon`) still work with a stderr deprecation notice. **The originally-planned merge into a single `supersurf` package is deferred** — the bare `supersurf` name is squatted on npm by a stale `0.0.1` placeholder (dead website, last touched ~10 months ago); an ownership dispute is in progress. Until it resolves, the two ship separately under the names we own: `supersurf-mcp` depends on `supersurf-daemon`, both versioned in lockstep, and the daemon is **not** bundled into the server. Install with `npx supersurf-mcp@latest mcp`
- **BREAKING: feat**: a server now refuses to attach to a daemon of a mismatched version. On `connect`, if the running daemon's version (sent on the `session_ack` handshake) differs from the server — or predates the version field — `connect` returns a `version_mismatch` error and tells the operator to restart the daemon. Prevents a fresh server from silently driving a stale daemon over the shared socket (protocol skew). Normal installs match (server + daemon version-locked), so this only fires when a stale daemon from a prior version is still running
- fix: managed-profile `connect` race — the daemon now opens the profile registration URL on **every** managed spawn, not just the first. Previously the registration page was gated behind `isFirstLaunch` (`!registry.isInitialized(profile)`), so re-spawning an already-initialized profile whose extension `chrome.storage.local` had lost `supersurf_profile` (force-kill, rsync'd macOS profile, Chrome corruption) handed the daemon a handshake with no `profile` field → the connection was pooled as `unmanaged`, the pending managed match never resolved, and `connect` timed out after retries (per-profile experiments like `mouse_humanization` silently never applied). Re-serving the registration page on every spawn re-arms the profile binding in extension storage and triggers the existing `storage.onChanged` → reconnect path. Companion guard: the extension's `storage.onChanged` listener now reconnects only when `supersurf_profile` actually changes, so re-arming on a healthy re-spawn (storage already correct) no longer tears down an already-matched connection. Note: the doc-proposed persistent-cookie fix would not have helped — on the failing path no registration page is served at all, so no cookie (session or persistent) is ever set
- fix: `browser_handle_dialog` no longer hangs when a native dialog has already fired. The tool was preventive-only — it injected MAIN-world `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` overrides via `chrome.scripting.executeScript`. Once a real dialog opened, the renderer's JS thread froze and `executeScript` couldn't run, so the call would time out at 30s. The handler now fires `Page.handleJavaScriptDialog` via CDP first (CDP bypasses the frozen JS thread), unfreezes the renderer, then re-injects the overrides. Surfaced by audit-log review where agents on Phenom Aurelia ATS pages (resume parser fires a native dialog before injection) repeatedly hit the timeout
- fix: auto-handle default for `confirm()` flipped from `accept=true` → `accept=false`. Auto-accepting confirms is destructive in too many cases (delete account, submit form, leave page); auto-dismissing is almost always safe. Agents that need accept call `browser_handle_dialog { accept: true }` explicitly
- feat: dialog events now ride every tool response via a `_dialogs` envelope (mirrors the existing `_recovery` envelope pattern). When a page fires a dialog during any tool call, the response status header now includes a `⚠ dialog fired: <type>: "<message>" → <response>` line per event — no polling required. Agents see exactly what the page asked for and how it was answered
- fix: `_dialogs` envelope was only being unwrapped inside `formatResult` (the MCP-envelope path used by ~6 tools), so dialogs that fired during `browser_interact`, `browser_navigate`, `browser_evaluate` etc. silently dropped on the floor. Moved aggregation to a per-dispatch hook in the tool dispatcher: `DaemonClient` strips `_dialogs` off every JSON-RPC response into a session buffer, and the dispatcher drains that buffer in its `finally` and prepends one consolidated notice — so multi-step tools that issue several extension RPCs per call surface every dialog fired across the dispatch
- fix: drain-tick race in the extension's dialog buffer. The previous implementation called `getDialogEvents` then `clearDialogEvents` as two separate `chrome.scripting.executeScript` invocations, and two consecutive 500ms drain ticks could both read the same events before the prior tick's clear landed — producing duplicate `⚠ dialog fired` lines in the agent-facing notice. Replaced with atomic `drainDialogEvents` that reads and clears `window.__supersurfDialogEvents` in a single MAIN-world execution
- fix: `setupDialogOverrides` injection failures (e.g. `chrome://` URLs, detached tabs) now propagate to the caller instead of being silently logged-and-swallowed. The old swallow masked real attachment bugs as no-ops
- feat: OS keychain credential store + `supersurf creds` CLI. New `shared/keychain` module abstracts a `KeychainBackend` (`add`/`get`/`list`/`remove`) over the platform keychain — macOS via the `security` CLI (`add-generic-password`/`find-generic-password`/`dump-keychain`), Linux via `secret-tool` (libsecret/Secret Service) — plus an `InMemoryKeychainBackend` for tests. All items are namespaced under `service="supersurf"` (the `SUPERSURF_SERVICE` constant), so SuperSurf only ever reads/writes its own credentials. New CLI surface routed through the bin dispatcher on the first positional arg: `supersurf creds add <name> [--domain <d>]` (reads the value from stdin, hidden in a TTY; never echoes), `supersurf creds list` (prints names + optional domain only — **values are never displayed**), and `supersurf creds rm <name>`. On unsupported platforms `getKeychainBackend()` throws and directs the operator to env-var fallback. **Storage layer + CLI only** — wiring the keychain into the `secure_fill` resolver chain (so fills resolve from keychain before `.env`) is a separate follow-up and is **not** in this change
- feat: config-drift warning — daemon now `fs.watch`es `~/.supersurf/config.json` post-startup, hashes the file at boot, and flips a drift flag when the on-disk hash diverges from the snapshot loaded at startup. The flag rides the IPC envelope (`config_drift: true` on `session_ack` and every JSON-RPC response). Server prepends a one-shot warning to the status header: `⚠️ ~/.supersurf/config.json changed since daemon start — config edits will not take effect until restart: npx supersurf daemon restart`. One-shot per MCP session (sticky-suppressed after first emission to avoid spam); reset on session restart. Motivation: config changes silently require a daemon restart, and operators kept editing `config.json` mid-session expecting hot-reload that doesn't exist
- feat: `profiles.startup_opts.disable_gpu` config knob — when set to `true` in `~/.supersurf/config.json`, the daemon appends `--disable-gpu` to every managed-profile Chromium spawn. Stability/compat lever for systems with flaky GPU drivers (black tabs, renderer crashes); **not** a performance win — disabling hardware compositing usually regresses scrolling and canvas/WebGL perf, so leave it `false` (the default) unless you have a concrete stability reason to flip it. Single global knob, no per-profile override. Requires daemon restart
- chore: `scripts/publish.ts` preflight now checks publish auth as a prerequisite before doing any release work — validates CWS client credentials + refresh-token freshness and npm-registry login (`npm whoami`), failing fast with the exact remediation command (`npm run cws.auth` / `npm login`) instead of partway through a release
- chore: `npm run smoke.pack` — npm-pack self-containment gate. Packs the `supersurf` tarball, installs it into a throwaway temp dir (no workspace symlinks), and `require()`s the bundled daemon + bin entrypoints under `VITEST=1` (so it never starts a real daemon or touches `~/.supersurf/`). Fails loudly if any bundled module is missing — catches an unshippable bundle that dev-time workspace symlinks would otherwise hide. Run before publishing

## 2.1.0 — 2026-05-22

- feat: `profiles` graduated from experiment to default behavior. Managed Chromium profiles, `profile_create`/`profile_list`/`profile_delete` MCP tools, and the connection-pool matchmaker are now always available — no `experiments.profiles: true` in `~/.supersurf/config.json` required. Decision data: 38,275 tool calls across 36 sessions / 11 versions, 95.9% success rate. No opt-out hatch — the single-connection-only daemon mode is retired; operators who do not need profile isolation can simply ignore the new tools or connect without the `profile` param (the "bring your own Chromium" path)
- BREAKING: removed `experiments.profiles` config key. Setting it in `~/.supersurf/config.json` will emit an "unknown top-level key" warning and otherwise be ignored. `SUPERSURF_EXPERIMENTS=profiles` likewise warns and is ignored
- BREAKING: removed `capabilities.profiles` from the daemon's `session_ack` handshake. MCP servers no longer guard profile tools on this capability — the gate is always open
- chore: added regression-lock tests asserting `profiles` is not present in `Config['experiments']`, not in `KNOWN_EXPERIMENTS`, and not in `DaemonExperimentRegistry.AVAILABLE_EXPERIMENTS`

## 2.0.0 — 2026-05-13

- **BREAKING: feat**: 3-layer ConfigService — CLI flag > env var > `~/.supersurf/config.json` > hardcoded defaults. Daemon auto-scaffolds `~/.supersurf/config.json` on first run with safe defaults. ConfigService lives in the `shared/` workspace so daemon and server consume one source of truth
- **BREAKING: feat**: `experimental_features` MCP tool removed. Experiments are now opted into via `~/.supersurf/config.json` and require a daemon restart. Rationale: audit-log data showed 4 of 5 historical callers used it once at startup; the remaining call sites became impossible after `secure_eval` graduated in v1.11.0
- **BREAKING: feat**: `AuditLogger` → `UsageMetricsLogger` rename. New session files are written as `metrics-{sessionId}-{ts}.ndjson` (was `audit-{sessionId}-{ts}.ndjson`). Older sessions remain at the old path; the usage-data-audit skill globs both prefixes
- **BREAKING: feat**: usage-metrics logging is now gated by `config.logging.usage_metrics`. Hardcoded default is `false`, scaffolded `~/.supersurf/config.json` default is `true` — operators who never touch config still get telemetry; operators with a config file opt in explicitly by leaving the default
- feat: `experiments.profiles` is now a first-class config key (equivalent to the legacy `SUPERSURF_EXPERIMENTS=profiles` env var, which still works as a fallback). Daemon-startup flag only — not session-toggleable. Profile tool descriptions and error messages now direct operators to edit `config.json` rather than set env vars
- feat: new env vars `SUPERSURF_CONFIG_FILE` (path override) and `SUPERSURF_DEBUG` (alias for `--debug`)
- chore: CLAUDE.md updated for v2 architecture
- chore: usage-data-audit skill updated to glob both `metrics-*.ndjson` and legacy `audit-*.ndjson`

## 1.11.0 — 2026-05-03

- fix: rewrote two confusing CDP error strings agents kept hitting after a page failed to load. `Target crashed` and `CDP timeout: Runtime.evaluate (50000ms)` now expand into self-explanatory messages with recovery steps — close the tab, reopen, do not retry heavy DOM queries on the dead page. Surfaced by an audit-log review where agents repeatedly retried `browser_evaluate` against a hung renderer for ~10 calls before giving up
- fix: `browser_navigate` (url + reload) now detects Chrome's error interstitial (`body.className === 'neterror'` or `chrome-error://` location) after the wait and returns a clear error instead of a silent success. Previously the response said the navigate succeeded — but the page never actually loaded, and the next heavy DOM query crashed the renderer
- security: `secure_eval` graduated from experiment to a default-on protection. Three-layer RCE defense (AST static analysis → extension Proxy membrane → page-context Proxy wrapper) now runs on every `browser_evaluate` call without per-session opt-in. Toggling via `experimental_features` returns an explicit error directing operators to the new opt-out. Disable via `--disable-secure-eval` CLI flag or `SUPERSURF_DISABLE_SECURE_EVAL=1` in the server env (not recommended)
- feat: sharpened `browser_evaluate` schema — explicit "NOT for" list redirecting agents to `browser_navigate`, `browser_storage`, `browser_fill_form`/`browser_interact`, `browser_network_requests`. `readOnlyHint` flipped to `true` and title now reads "Evaluate JS (read-only)"
- fix: `browser_fill_form` now walks child frames when a selector misses the top frame — same DFS isolated-world pattern v1.10.0 added to `browser_interact`. Closes the iframe-nested form-field gap (52% of active fill_form errors in the audit logs) on iCIMS, embedded form-builders, and payment widgets
- fix: digit-leading element IDs (e.g. Ashby's `#883a762f-8c9b-...` UUIDs) are now transparently rewritten to `[id="..."]` form before reaching `document.querySelector`. CSS forbids ID identifiers that start with a digit — page-internal querySelector throws `SyntaxError: not a valid selector` — but Ashby (and others) emit them anyway. Closes 36% of active fill_form errors

## 1.10.1 — 2026-05-01

- chore: internal refactor — split `tools.ts` into `tools/lib/` (shared primitives: cdp, frames, sandbox, element-resolver, result-formatter, dispatcher, types) and split `tools/interaction.ts` into per-action files. No behavior change

## 1.10.0 — 2026-04-22

- feat: `browser_interact` actions with a `selector` now auto-fall-back to child frames on top-frame miss — DFS-walks the frame tree via `Page.createIsolatedWorld` and resolves elements in iframe-local coords back to top-frame viewport coords. Eliminates "Element not found" failures on iframe-nested elements (iCIMS, embedded form-builders, payment widgets) without forcing agents to think about frames

## 1.9.3 — 2026-04-17

- feat: `browser_evaluate` requires a `purpose` parameter — a free-text field where the agent explains why evaluate is needed instead of a dedicated tool (`browser_lookup`, `browser_extract_content`, `browser_interact`, `browser_fill_form`, `browser_navigate`, `browser_get_element_styles`). Captured in the audit log for intent analysis. Missing/empty purpose is rejected before dispatch
- feat: contextual tip suppression — if a tip fires 3 consecutive times for the same (session, tool, tip_id), it is suppressed on subsequent calls until that tool is called without triggering it (per-tip reset). Stops high-volume repeat coaching (the `browser_lookup` tip fired 261 times in the recent job-search sessions with a 2% follow-through rate) from becoming wallpaper. Counters clear on `disconnect`

## 1.9.2 — 2026-04-10

- feat: profile tools (`profile_list`, `profile_create`, `profile_delete`) work without `connect`/`disconnect` — handlers spin up a temporary daemon connection when no active session exists, so agents can manage profiles from passive state
- chore: added `npm run tree` script for listing project source files
- chore: CLAUDE.md updated to reflect v1.9.1 state — added daemon experiments layer, tips system, dotenv, sandbox, chrome types, and missing test entries

## 1.9.1 — 2026-04-08

- chore: `scripts/publish.ts` now owns git tagging — `scripts/version.bump.ts` no longer creates tags. Tags only exist for versions actually shipped, so re-bumping or amending after a bump is free (no tag cleanup). Publish is idempotent on retry — existing tag at HEAD is reused, push failure on a freshly-created tag rolls it back for a clean retry

## 1.9.0 — 2026-04-08

- feat: `file_upload` walks child frames when the selector isn't found in the top frame — uses `Page.getFrameTree` + per-frame isolated worlds. Closes the iCIMS / Stripe / embedded form-builder gap where file inputs live inside iframes. Top-frame happy path is unchanged
- feat: tab recovery is now visible to agents — `BrowserBridge.formatResult()` extracts the `_recovery` envelope from extension responses and prefixes the response with `↻ tab recovered: stale tab N → M (url)` so agents know the tab changed mid-call
- fix: `fill_form` dispatches `new Event('input', ...)` instead of `new InputEvent('input', ...)` — `InputEvent` was routing some React versions down a composition-event path that bypassed the value tracker, leaving controlled-input state stale (e.g. Lever ATS `Resume_URL` silent failure). Per facebook/react#10135

## 1.8.0 — 2026-04-08

- feat: `browser_snapshot` coalesces adjacent `InlineTextBox` siblings into a single text node — cuts AX tree noise on text-heavy pages where Chrome splits long runs into per-line boxes
- feat: lightweight tab recovery — `ensureAttachedTab()` auto-recovers when the attached tab is null or stale (crashed/closed) instead of failing the call. Recovery prefers the active visible tab in the focused window. Surfaces `_recovery: { reason, previousTabId, newTabId, url }` on the result so agents know the tab changed
- feat: backend tool audit entries (`connect`/`disconnect`/`status`/`experimental_features`/`reload_mcp`/`profile_*`) now populate the `url` field — closes a session-boundary blind spot in audit analysis

## 1.7.0 — 2026-04-08

- fix: `browser_evaluate` function form now wraps as IIFE so arrow/async functions actually execute (previously returned `undefined`)
- fix: `fill_form` selector escaping — selectors with single quotes (e.g. ATS UUID-attribute selectors `[id='uuid-...']`) no longer break the inline JS template
- feat: `select_custom` fuzzy option matcher — 6-tier scoring (exact → alphanumeric → startsWith → substring) recovers from real-world ATS label mismatches like "United States" → "United States +1"
- feat: post-action validation for `fill_form`, `select_custom`, and `file_upload` — tools now read back DOM state after the mutation and prefix results with `✓` (verified) or `⚠` (mutation ran but read-back didn't confirm)
- docs: research note on the React value-tracker silent-failure mode for `fill_form` — DOM-level read-back is necessary but not sufficient to catch React state drift; fiber-walk verification deferred to a follow-up

## 1.6.5 — 2026-04-01

- feat: show tethered profile name in extension popup — makes identity theft between managed profiles immediately visible
- fix: version bump rollback now restores version files to previous version instead of leaving them bumped

## 1.6.0 — 2026-03-28

- feat: targeted tool tips — 14 contextual hints appended to tool responses when agents use `browser_evaluate` for things purpose-built tools already handle (clicks, scrolls, value setting, DOM reads, position lookups, style inspection, innerHTML extraction)
- feat: `:has-text()` pseudo-selector documented in `browser_interact` schema description
- feat: `version` and `tip` fields in audit log entries for version correlation and tip effectiveness analysis
- fix: `select_custom` scopes option search to newly-opened dropdown via before/after diffing — fixes 87.5% error rate on pages with multiple custom dropdowns (e.g. Greenhouse job boards)
