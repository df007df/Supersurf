 * separately, in its own pass; see `buildHandleIndex`).
 *
 * Exact-string keys only — no fuzzy matching. The `browser_snapshot` form-field
 * collector synthesises `tag#id` first and `tag[name="..."]` second (see
 * tools/content.ts:88-96); `browser_lookup`'s in-page collector only ever emits
 * `tag#id` or a class-based shape, no `[name="..."]` branch (see
 * tools/content.ts:196-201) — the `tag[name="..."]` derived key exists for the
 * snapshot collector. Neither collector ever emits a bare `#id` — both always
 * prepend the tag name first — so a bare `#id` key is not derived; a record whose
 * own stored selector genuinely is `#foo` is already covered by the own-selector
 * pass.
 *
 * Class-based shapes (`tag.a.b`) are deliberately NOT indexed: framework-hashed
 * class names churn between deploys and the collectors truncate to the first two
 * classes in DOM order, so a class key would produce confident wrong answers. A
 * miss renders exactly as it does today, which is the correct failure mode.
